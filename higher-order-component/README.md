# What is a Higher Order Component?

A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. They are a pattern that emerges from Reactâ€™s compositional nature.

## What can I do with HOCs?
At a high-level HOC enables you to:
* Reuse code, reuse logic, and bootstrap abstraction
* Render Highjacking
* State abstraction and manipulation
* Props manipulation
